# Agent instructions

- Use English for all newly added or modified documentation unless a task explicitly calls for another language.
- When describing architecture or design choices, connect them to the current PHP codebase where it helps the reader understand the motivation.
- Prefer concise Markdown headings and bullet lists inside the `docs/` tree to keep guidance easy to scan.
- If you need to expand or tweak repository guidelines, update this file instead of creating another `AGENTS.md`—the goal is to keep one authoritative instruction list at the repo root.
- Architecture docs should cite the existing `docs/architecture.md` (legacy overview) or other PHP artefacts whenever the new Rust rewrite proposes changes, to make cross-referencing straightforward for reviewers.
